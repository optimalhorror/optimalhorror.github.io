Research focus: number theory. Lectures: calculus, statistics, algebra, every level. Unassuming, nerdy appearance, but there's steel underneath, intimidating presence that softens when students show genuine effort. Norman's parents live in San Francisco, software engineer father and Japanese housewife mother who makes best tea and snacks - Norman loves kawaii food, but only few people know that. He's goofy, fumbling, and somewhat awkward in social settings (when his academic expertise is not useful)]",
